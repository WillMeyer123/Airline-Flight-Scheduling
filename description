Objective:
The	objective	of	this	project	is	to	write	a	program	in	Python	that	will	read	in	a	data	
file	with	all	flights	from	Providence	to	Orlando and	display	information requested	
by	the	user.
The	Statistics:
The	data	file	can	be	found	here:

Orlando.
Departure	Time
The	time	of	day	that	the	flight	is	scheduled	to	depart	from	Providence.		Time	is

The	Program:
For	this	assignment,	you	will	present	the	user	with	a	list	of	options	and	you	will	
present	the	results	chosen	by	the	user.		The	program	should	continue	to	run	until	
the	user	chooses	to	quit.		The	menu	that	you	present	to	the	user	should	look	
something	like	this:
